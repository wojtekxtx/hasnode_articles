# Hackernoon

**Strong language warning**

Ive been browsing feed here on HashNode and stumbled upon HackerNoon (HN).

Registered, here are my thoughts:

# UI
This CSS resembles early age of computing or video games. May like it or not. For me: **its disgusting**.
## Overall look & feel
This is how it looks on Mac from Safari:
![Zrzut ekranu 2022-10-10 o 14.37.44.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1665405484442/4lMPMka8_x.png align="left")

What the fucking fuck is this?! I mean: these eye-blinding colours. As if high-contrast has been enabled. What a shit!

## Specifics
### CSS
Here is clean, unedited `CSS` of HN:
```css
/* Make clicks pass-through */
#nprogress {
  pointer-events: visible;
}

#nprogress .bar {
  background: #3c3c3b;
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 1031;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;

  width: 100%;
  height: 5px;
}

/* Fancy blur effect */
#nprogress .peg {
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  right: 0px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100%;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px #3c3c3b, 0 0 5px #3c3c3b;
  opacity: 1;

  -webkit-transform: rotate(3deg) translate(0px, -4px);
  -ms-transform: rotate(3deg) translate(0px, -4px);
  transform: rotate(3deg) translate(0px, -4px);
}

/* Remove these to get rid of the spinner */
#nprogress .spinner {
  display: block;
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 1031;
  top: 15px;
  right: 15px;
}

#nprogress .spinner-icon {
  width: 18px;
  height: 18px;
  box-sizing: border-box;

  border: solid 2px transparent;
  border-top-color: #3c3c3b;
  border-left-color: #3c3c3b;
  border-radius: 50%;

  -webkit-animation: nprogress-spinner 400ms linear infinite;
  animation: nprogress-spinner 400ms linear infinite;
}

.nprogress-custom-parent {
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
}

.nprogress-custom-parent #nprogress .spinner,
.nprogress-custom-parent #nprogress .bar {
  position: absolute;
}

@-webkit-keyframes nprogress-spinner {
  0% {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  100% {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
@keyframes nprogress-spinner {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```
Take a look at this:
```css
/* Make clicks pass-through */
#nprogress {
  pointer-events: visible;
}
```
So: there is another, hidden from view ( = transparent ) layer that catches userclicks. Seriously this kind of shady tactics in XXI century? God knows what is hidden from user on this layer?! It can be anything: some malicious code that runs on `pageLoad`? Some reference to specific malicious function sitting somewhere out of HN? You cannot be sure.

### Special actions ( starting with `@` sign )
Is this ( abovementioned `css` document ) some kind of framework? No; it applies to **standalone web-app**. So, what the fuck SA's doing there?

### Cross-browser-compliance (CBC)
This one is pretty good. HN looks similar on all major browsers.

# UX
## Editor(s)
Starting to write articles we can select desired editor we will be writing in; we can choose between:
* Editor 2.0,
* Editor 3.0.

### Editor 2.0
Pretty much standard-looking, Markdown supporting, editor. Nothing extraorfinary. Just works as it should.
Built using [SlateJS](https://www.slatejs.org/), it is very extensible, clean editor.

### Editor 3.0
Well, this is where fun begins. It has L&F exactly like `Editor 2.0`, with the exception that.....its not working. At all. **It behaves like a mock**. Nothing works.

#### Enigmatic error messages with counter (!)
From time to time, during editing/drafting a post, it displays message in the form of `modalBox()`with red background, white text, **disappearing after less than 5 seconds**, saying that:

> there was an error talking to our server

Wait, what? Live app looses connection mildst working? Hell, true. However inmature it sounds.

#### Editors' repository
As its open source, source code of editor 3.0, called `Rich Markdown Editor` is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/hackernoon/rich-markdown-editor).

OK, nice thing, you say? Right, but **this is only a fork** of [real `Outline Editor`](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) meaning that:
* people with commit access to first abovementioned repo can only commit to their **fork**, not to upstream, hence not being able to commit to `main` branch, make releases, etc; in other words, to fully maintain their fork.
* they ( people responsible for `git` within HN team ) have **no knowledge** how git works.

# Other things
## Revisions
Upon completing writing an article, to make your article visible, it needs to be reviewed. They give themselves upto as week for this. Seriously? Yes, dead serious. What the fucking fuck is this?

This is [how they put it](https://help.hackernoon.com/what-happens-when-i-submit-a-story-to-hacker-noon)

I understand nothing.........

## No replies
Thinking of contacting team behind HN? Dont. They will never respond. Ive sent them mail 4 days ago. To this day no respomnse at all!

## Delete account? No way!
Team dont want you to delete your account as there is no such option throughout UI.

# Ending
I do not recommend HackerNoon.
