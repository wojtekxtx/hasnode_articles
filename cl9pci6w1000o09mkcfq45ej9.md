# Strange Safari behaviuor

My MacBook was updated yesterday ( 25.X.2022 ). All went well, system is workable, but Ive noticed two things:
* Safari start-up time has been lengthen-up quite considerably,
* Once it loads, when I click on address bar, and than move the pointer **out of this bar**, it looses focus = I cannot write webpage I want to go to.

Annoying, but lets hope Apple fixes this.
