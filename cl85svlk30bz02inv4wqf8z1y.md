People treat **Frontend development** like some mythical beast that only a few can tame. But the truth is, it's not that hard.

**Flexbox** and **Grid** are two of the most effective **CSS** tools that you can use to create layouts, but might be a tad overwhelming at first. But once you get the hang of it, they will be your **go-to tools**.

# Target Different Devices with Media Queries

You never know the device your users will be using to access your website. So it's crucial to make sure that your website looks **responsive** on **devices of all shapes and sizes**.

**Media Queries** solves that exact problem by allowing the developer to **specify styles for each and every screen size**

# Utilize Pseudo-classes & Pseudo-elements

**Pseudo-classes** and **Pseudo-elements** are **CSS** selectors that allow you to select **elements when certain conditions have been met** or **specific parts of an element**.

They can be utilized to add **interactivity** (**updating a button style when hovered** or **pressed**) and **life** (**add quotes** or **style the first letter of a paragraph differently**) to your website.

# Create Eye-catching animations

Want to make your site stand out? **Animations** is a great tool to achieve just that!

It can be as simple as adding the `transition` property to an **element** used in combination with **pseudo-classes** or something more complex like creating a **custom animation** using `keyframes`.

# Join the Dark Side by adding Shadows

**Shadow** is a great way to add **depth** to your website. **CSS** allows you to add various types of shadows, namely **box-shadow**, **text-shadow**, and **drop-shadow**. Knowing when to use it will get you a long way.

**NOTE**: **Shadows** don't necessarily have to be **dark**.

# Position elements

How to **position** elements is crucial for **frontend development** after you get over the beginner stage. By not knowing how **static**, **relative**, **absolute**, **fixed**, and **sticky** elements are positioned, you would end up limiting yourself drastically.

# Smooth out the jagged edges

The `border-radius` property allows the developer to create a **polished UI**. It's a great tool to pocket in your arsenal if you aim to develop highly **professional UX**.
