## Why not Medium?

# Intro
Just wanted to start blogging. There are many platforms that allow just that. Some proprietary and paid, some allow you to join, post for free.

This post is not going to be stricte coparing these platforms, I just want to say why I selected Hashnode and what made me stay out of its biggest competitor: Medium.

# Medium

## Rant
Just look at it. Forcers everywhere. Everywhere you look, every page you browse, bam, there it says: Get unlimited access. Pay or see forcers. GTFO normal/sane writer.
Also, there are no tooltips.

UI is clogged.
UX is also screwed up.

## Praise
I see none.

## Rant
None.
## Praise
Extremely good, free for real, blogging platform. Both UI and UX are excellent, top of the tops.
