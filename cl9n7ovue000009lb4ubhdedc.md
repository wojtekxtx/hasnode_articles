especially this part:
> Non-members get a select number of free stories in their member preview, which replenishes on the first of each month.

Seriously Medium? I mean what the fucking fuck?

My questions:
* what is `select number`? What are the basis of that selection? Is it adjustable in user profile or somewhere?
* `replenishes on the first of each month.` meaning `use up your limit and GTFO from medium.com till 1st of next month`?

You know what Medium.com? **Fuck you !!!**
