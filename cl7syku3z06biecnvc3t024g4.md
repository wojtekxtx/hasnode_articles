## Moodle: my journey

Hell, another entry that I vent my frustration in. Yes, FOSS shitware (as I call it), makes me extremely sick.

Another shitware representative that I dedicate this entry to is moodle. Its ( or desperately tries to be ) LMS.

Dont get me wrong: Martin ( founder & ceo ) had brilliant idea: to let every person on this planet make use of education. I fully support this idea; I personally think that education is crucial.

But, Martin, as every ceo of any shitware project, screw it all up. Big time.

# Offering
When you go to moodle website ( which is correct website btw: ending in `org` or in `com`? Take a wild guess stranger ) you are presented with 2 options:
* selfhost ( standard download ) :: free for real,
* use cloud ( called moodlecloud ) :: was free, now pay hefty price to use.

## My rant

Both of above options are seriously flawed.
* selfhost: webinstaller is so shitty that either doesnt work, spits out blankpage, or, this one is good, **creates wrong tables in db**. Not to mention that their official manual is just another crappy thing: following it wfw will result in **broken installation**, or, whats more likely, **not functioning server**. But, they give a shit about it.
* moodlecloud: was once free, they cancelled free-forever offering out of greed ( pandemic start = end of free-forever tier ). They lie about it left and right. More? Tons of ads, "site registration" without option to disable it, and done **without user/admin knowlege and consent**. BTW where is this catalogue you are forced to register in, what its used for ( as I dont believe that they dont use our data from it ), who governs this catalogue, etc. So many questions; so little do we know. Transparency anyone?

Another thing is price of moodlecloud. Over $100 /yearly for something that is way too high/hefty. There are some countries in the world that:
* would like their citizens to be educated,
* GDP is so low, that even $100 yearly is way too much.

As usual, moodle team gives a fuck about it.

# User experience, bugs, etc
## UX
UX in moodle `4*` branch was ( according to their website ) greatly improved. I personally see no improvement, just opposite in fact, UX went down to the point of not existence even. **Its nightmare**.

## Bugs
### BLB
Business logic is flawed in so many places that there are more things done wrong than there is done right. Everything. From admin index, through course creation/editing, user management, comments, to overall sizing/placement of sections.....

## My rant
Martin (and the rest of team) fucked this aspect as well. Ofc they cannot justify their decisions.

# Team "friendliness"
Another aspect is team behaviour once they are criticized. They give out some shitty, out of context answer/s and, eventually, they **ban user** saying that user is rude, not behaving in adherence to their shitty CoC/ToS or something.

Friendliness at its best.

Oh, I almost forgot. During some discussion on their forum I was asked how would I change moodle. I replied that I would do complete rewrite. Guess what the answer was. That __"there were many people before me that suggested this and they still havent seen any code from these people"__. 

Guess why there is no code comming from these people? Two reasons:
* people will not devote their free time to write code unless given guarantee that their code will be merged into `stable`; pretty obvious; Im seriously suprised teammoodle ignores it.
* people arent stupid: they clearly see whats going on, and they share my point of view ( although they are not as vocal as Im about it ).
