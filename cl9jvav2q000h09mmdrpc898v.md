# IDEs: Integrated Developer Enviromment

As someone with 20+ years of experience in REAL coding, I feel Im ready to write this.

Problem is: every IDE out there has flaws. These flaws are either deliberately introduced (by motherfuckers like nikita popov from that shit [php.net](https://medium.com/u/515a3a6e2910) ), or as a form of mistake.

Thats why many REAL world developers (myself included) outed fully fledged IDEs long ago. They are totally ok with many standalone apps rather than one all-in-one kind.

Im not saying that IDEs are all bad. There are some good ones, but what they have in common, is that authors try to force users ( developers ) into specific thinking way ( sometimes called *their way* ) and, finally, to take userâ€™s freedom away from developer. **I dont like this.**

So what I use? [This](https://www.gitpod.io/). Self-hosted. It even has builtin IDE ( `visual studio code`) of sorts. For free. No hidden costs, in-app purchases, or other shady tactics.
