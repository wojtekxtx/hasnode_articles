## Fuckup #1

# Intro
Ive been [exploring Github](https://github.com/explore) recently and found [this project](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter).
Wow, another `syntax highlighter`, isnt it good there are so many out there? Well, after little bit of digging, answer is **not really**

# Explanation
## Variety of `highlighters`
There is absolutely nothing wrong in having multiple **mature** projects that serves the same, common, goal; the more variety, the better. But. as the proverb goes, "the more of sth, the poorer the quality of things". Thats true also in this case.
There are many `syntax highlighters` out there on GitHub, some more free than others, some better, some worse.

## So, if variety is good, than whats the matter?
Thing is: **there is absolutely no justification in making many tools that serves common goal**. At least I fail to see one.

Better to have one, well-built, well-maintained, tool, per common goal, than to have many tools, each one unfinished.

## Other projects included !
Same is true not only to `syntax highlighters`, but to any type of project in fact.
