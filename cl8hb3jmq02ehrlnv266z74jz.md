## freecodecamp or freeshitcamp?

@[Quincy Larson](@quincy) had brilliant idea to start a platform where newbies would learn everything from basics to advanced topics on widely-understood, IT for absolutely free. Idea was brilliant.

As it is with brilliant ideas in CFG cumfield, something went wrong

# Repo

Main project repo is, ofc, [on GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
By browsing it more dickally, you will notice that there is fuckload of problems:

# Problems
## Engine choice

No wannabe-serious project should use `node`. **Never, ever.** Period. I will write another article why `node` sucks big time.

## Infrastructure as with huge multicompanies project

There are 3 enviroments: 
* `beta`,
* `staging`,
* `production`.

Why? Is freecodecamp really that big, processing critical data? Fuck no. So why? Because of Quincy's ego. Someone has to pay bills for this infrastructure.

## Multiple issues untouched by human, but touched by BOTS

Thats HUGE problem. See below.

People create various issues and these issues are not interfered with by humans, but rather than by bots that helps automate things.

While I agree that automation can be good thing, there are **way too many bots employed in freecodecamp's repo**.

Bots are overly used.

## Security
### Policy
Currently, it resides in `docs/policy.md` within `main` repo branch.

#### My thoughts on this
Generally ok, file may have been formatted diferentlky, but thats minor issue.

### Advisories
Although patched, currently there are 3 advisories present:

Seriously @[Quincy Larson](@quincy) doesnt know how to close SA/ask for closure/mark SA as done? If so, there is absolutely no place for him as a person with admin rights to the repo! Period.

Most highest places are occupied by bots. WTF @[Quincy Larson](@quincy)?

Seriously @[Quincy Larson](@quincy)? Only 54 contributions in 9 years (!) from you as a project leader? WTF?
