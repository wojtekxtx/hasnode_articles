Its taken from [@php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src/commits/master) repo.

The very same pattern is being repeated every now & than.

**What the fucking fuck is this?!**

I know that `git` as a `VCS` is sixable, but FUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You may ask:
> Whats wrong than?

**Its not `git`** thats to be blamed here. Its core team behind `php/php-src` repo! Its not even commiter ( smalyshev ) fault. Its fault of whoever set rules like commiting ruleset (CRS). Possibly one of these fuckers: either:
* nikita popov,
* dmitriy stogov.

Both from Russia. No big letters as I dont pay respect to assholes.
