# Switch Chrome >> Brave

As many of you know, I'm a lover of macOS. Extremely flawless system. Today, I was "forced" to map a new browser. My choice? Brave Browser. Simply because it's fully compatible with Chrome.

As it turned out after installation, I had Brave installed once as all my data was there. Quick search for how to delete my browser cache, and here we go, I'm on a fresh install.

## Where?

```bash
/Users/<username>/Library/Cache/BraveBrowser
```

Remove that folder, start `Brave` and you should see `Quick Start Guide`.

Pretty straightforward.
