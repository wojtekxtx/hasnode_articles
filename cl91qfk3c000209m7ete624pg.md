# How To Fix Visual Studio Code IntelliSense Loading Indefinitely

The symptoms of this issue are putting your mouse on something where you‚Äôd expect the IntelliSense guidelines, but instead you only see the ‚ÄúLoading‚Ä¶‚Äù text.

In this short article, I‚Äôm sharing the reason of this issue and my way of fixing it.

# How VS Code Infinite IntelliSense Loading Looks Like

This is what I struggled with:

As you can see, I didn‚Äôt get any IntelliSense while hovering my mouse on various elements in the editor.

A similar thing happened when I tried to use `Go to References` (or `Shift` + `F12` on Windows) for any object:

As you can see, the loading bar at the top of VS Code was showing progress indefinitely.

Let‚Äôs now see how to fix this annoying issue üòâ

# Fixing Visual Studio Code IntelliSense Loading Infinitely

After quite long investigation, I finally found the reason. It turned out that **[sometimes your Visual Studio Code might be using a different TypeScript version than your workspace uses](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-newer-typescript-versions)**. In my case, it was exactly the cause of the infinite loading problem üßê

In order to fix it, use `TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version...` command. You can access commands with `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows or `‚áß‚åòP` on Mac:

Select this command and tell Visual Studio Code to use the workspace version of TypeScript:

As you can see on the screenshot above, in my case the VS Code‚Äôs TypeScript version was `4.8.2`, while the workspace version was `4.8.3`. Changing it to use the newer, workspace version solved the problem. Visual Studio Code IntelliSense loading indefinitely issue was gone üéâ

If it doesn‚Äôt work straightaway, you might need to **restart your VS Code editor**.
