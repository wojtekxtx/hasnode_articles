## Connected my blog to GH

Just connected my blog to GitHub so my posts are being backuped on-the-fly.

Just follow these steps:

- on GitHub, create **public, initialized with readme** repo
- Login to HashNode;
- Your avatar > `blog name` > Blog Dashboard,
- Integrations > Install GH integration

Now, just follow on-screen wizard. Once successfully connected, you should see backup availability page.

Thats it.
