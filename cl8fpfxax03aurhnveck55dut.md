## Practical Data Structure and Algorithm Fundamentals Every Programmer Must Know

Fret not my friend, this article will provide you a **comprehensive list of topics** you should know regardless you want to **crack an interview at a product-based company** or become a **freelancer who is paid based on the products you create**.

# Arrays

This is simply the **most used data structure in the world**, without the knowledge of **arrays**, programmers will definitely mock you.

For **Arrays** skills you should focus on are:

1. **Searching**: **Linear search** & **binary search** are absolutely essential to know.
2. **Sorting**: Learn a few **sorting algorithms** and the trade-off between them. You can start off with the easy ones like **bubble sort** and **selection sort**, but should definitely have the knowledge of **insertion sort**, **merge sort**, and **quicksort**.
3. **Multidimensional Arrays**: Don't restrict yourself only to 1D **arrays**, you can also use 2D **arrays**, popularly known as matrices, but you rarely go beyond 2D **arrays** (unless you are in the field of data science).

# Stacks, Queues, and Deques

Occasionally they are also called **pseudo data structures**, as they don't require a strict ordering such as continuous blocks of memory in an **array** or the pointer structure of a **linked list**.

**Stacks**, **Queues**, and **Deques** can be implemented using both **arrays** and **linked lists**. The only mandate is following the **LIFO**, **FIFO**, and **Deque paradigms** (even though the **linked list** is more optimized for the implementation than **arrays**).

Having some practical experience with these **data structures** will suffice for most cases.

# Hash Maps and Hash Lists

**Hash Maps** are probably the most used data structure on the planet, after **arrays**. They are widely used for efficient searches. From **JavaScript Objects** to **Python dictionaries**, they are everywhere.

The use of **Hash Lists** isn't that common, but they too have niche applications. In most languages, they are known as **Sets**.

# Trees

**Trees** are quite useful **data structures**, especially while storing hierarchical data.

There are specific types of **trees**, that are commonly used:

1. **Binary Trees**: A **binary tree** is a tree in which each node has at most two children.
2. **Binary Search Trees**: A **binary search tree** is a **binary tree** in which all the nodes are arranged in such a way that the left subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3. **Trie**: A **trie**, also known as **prefix tree**, is a tree data structure that is typically used to preprocess a set of strings.

For **trees**, you should learn the **traversals**, **searches**, and **node insertions**.

# Algorithms

Apart from the **Data Structures** specific **algorithms**, some crucial paradigms to get acquainted with are:

1. **Recursion**: is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to tiny instances of the same problem.
2. **Greedy**: approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment
3. **Dynamic Programming**: is a technique that breaks the problems into sub-problems, and saves the result for future purposes so that we do not need to compute the result again.
4. **Backtracking**: A recursive technique to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.
